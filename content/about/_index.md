Hello there, My name is Stephen Ajulu.

I’m a remote freelancer, front end web developer, graphic designer, I.T Consultant, Branding Expert and Content Creator based in Nairobi, Kenya. I love building and creating things e.g. brands, companies, products, tools, content and more, Since growing up I have always had this innate curiosity of finding out what things are made of and how I can tear them down only to build them up again. Some of my first jobs in Web development was reverse engineering website themes based on a client’s want, something i still do today only rarely.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Technology and have completed a Diploma in Information Technology, a Certificate in Business Information Technology, an Ethical Hacking Certification(CEH local), Adobe Photoshop and Corel Draw, a System Troubleshooting Certification, French Level 1 Language and finally did the basics/fundamentals of Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity and Web Development.

I am a self taught “technologist”, hence 60% of my skills come from Online Courses.

To top that off I am a tech enthusiast always interested in trends such as Progressive Web Apps, The Comeback of Static Sites(e.g. Hugo), Machine Learning/AI, Quantum Computing, Big Data, VR/AR/MR, Blockchain, 3D printing and Robotics.
